alfonsoxiii:0 "Viva el Rey!"
alfonsoxiii_desc:0 "King Alfonso XIII, ''El Africano'', has ruled Spain since his mother's regency ended in 1902. Though Spain is legally a constitutional monarchy, in recent years he has become the favorite child of the aristocrats, and is practically running the country himself. With the start of the new decade, the King's plan to modernize the country continues. Viva Rey Alfonso!"
tiempososcuros:0 "Restoration of Hope"
tiempososcuros_desc:0 "There are few Spaniards who would claim things have been going well over the last few years. Indeed, the public has lost faith in the idea of a resurgance, seeing Spain doomed to be an impoverished backwater. Letting the public in on some of the King's grand plans would ideally at least give people something to look forward to."
pistolerismo:0 "Pistolerismo" #currently unused
pistolerismo_desc:0 "El incremento de fuerza y apoyos de los sindicatos ha suscitado una reacción inesperada y violenta en los empresarios de nuestro país" #currently unused
industriaenelnorte:0 "Basque Steel"
industriaenelnorte_desc:0 "British trade ships have been regularly visiting Bilbao, in the Basque Counties, with loads of cheap coal. This has led to a minor steel boom in the region, which we could invest in ourselves. Though this would put Spain at some mercy towards the British, economic growth has been hard to come by recently and this could be a positive example of it."
caciquismo:0 "Reign in Caciquismo"
caciquismo_desc:0 "In Caciquismo, party bosses (or ''Caciques'') control the voters in parliamentary elections and often speak on their behalf to the government. While an important part in keeping the illusion of democracy running, their ambitions and ideas are dangerous. We should remind the Caciques just who's in charge."
africanismo:0 "Across the Strait"
africanismo_desc:0 "After the disaster of 1898, our only colonies of any real worth are our port cities on the Moroccan coast. We must turn our attention across the Strait and make every diplomatic and military effort to maintain and expand our hold on these outposts, to ensure Spain's place as a world power. The dispute between France and Germany seems to present a nice opportunity..."
unanuevaflota:0 "The New Armada"
unanuevaflota_desc:0 "There almost is no Spanish fleet. Since our defeat at the hands of the Yankees, our navy has consisted of a small group of screening vessels and ironclad cruisers, mostly from decades ago. How would we protect our colonies or trade without one? We must rebuild our fleet, and soon, to ensure the safety of what's left of the empire."
planagricola:0 "Plan Agricola"
planagricola_desc:0 "Very little has changed in the Spanish countryside since the Reconquista. Obsolete tools, obsolete practices, and land ownership laws that just make things even worse. Fortunately, Plan Agricola has been laid out which seeks to address all of these deficiencies, which will hopefully get our farmers on track to modern times."

lasuniones:0 "Fight the Unions"
lasuniones_desc:0 "The fledgling Spanish economy is hindered greatly by Socialist and Communist-supporting Unions throughout the Spanish countryside. Highly organized, political, and cooperative, they present the biggest danger to economic growth and our regime. The bosses have told us they can handle it- perhaps we should trust their judgement."
turnismo:0 "Obscuring Turno"
turnismo_desc:0 "''El Turno Pacífico'' is the system by which our good King exerts power. Controlled elections between two ideologically identical parties gives the illusion of democracy. In reality, both sides work for Alfonso. However, the people have largely figured out what's happening here. Some smoke and mirrors to hide the process will assure the people the broken system works."
lasemanatragica:0 "Moving On"
lasemanatragica_desc:0 "La Semana Tragica is long over, but the scars still remain on the face of Spanish politics. Providing the most basic compensation and promise of reform would rile up the bosses and nationalists who oppose any sort of compromise with the Catalan unionists, making amends would certainly be good for the country."
expedientepicaso:0 "Restore Order in Melilla"
expedientepicaso_desc:0 "After the disaster the was the attack on Melilla in 1909, we have conquered back most of the old exclave, though administration has yet to return. Setting back up colonial rule, rather than occupation, will spare the military resources to pursue the Rif guerillas further."
laexperienciadeafrica:0 "Guerilla War Veterans"
laexperienciadeafrica_desc:0 "Though fighting Rifan irregulars is a bit different than fighting France or Germany, the sporadic battles against insurgents have given our backwards-thinking army some much-needed experience in modern warfare."
laburguesiacatalana:0 "Rapid Expansion in Barcelona"
laburguesiacatalana_desc:0 "Barcelona, strategically placed on the Mediterranean sea in close proximity to both France and Italy, is in a prime spot for industrial expansion. A rapid buildup could be a great short-term fix to get Spanish industry back on the map, though the rushed nature of construction and the unfriendly business administration may upset some locals."
institutonacionalprevision:0 "Workplace Safety Standards"
institutonacionalprevision_desc:0 "The Instituto Nacional de Previsión, a workplace safety organization, has been largely ignored and ineffective since its inception in 1908. In a time where unions and business antagonize each other, perhaps some modest government intervention, in this case by expanding the organization, could quell the anger of the union workers."
estabilizandoelpais:0 "Restore Hope"
estabilizandoelpais_desc:0 "With the first set of the good king's reforms now complete, we should now focus on letting the people know of our achievements. With real reforms that at least seem like they might improve everyday life in place for the first time in decades, perhaps some optimism will return to the tone and tenor of Spain."
tratadodefez:0 "Protectorate in Morocco"
tratadodefez_desc:0 "Becoming a signatory of the Treaty of Fes as well as signing the Franco-Spanish Treaty regarding Morocco, we have expanded our grasp over the Rif region. Organizing our holdings into the Spanish Protectorate in Morocco, giving us control over the region, as well as a more major stake in the Strait."
reformandoelejercito:0 "End the Quintas system"
reformandoelejercito_desc:0 "The Quintas system just isn't working. The conscripts are openly disloyal and are woefully untrained, and the economic recovery means too many are now able to pay their way out. Ending the system and replacing it with a more fair and standard conscription system will be more efficient and please the people."
juntaampliacionestudios:0 "Expand the Board of Education"
juntaampliacionestudios_desc:0 "Even the most staunch patriot would probably have to admit that the Spanish education system is deficient. One of the issues is an incompetent Board of Education, full of nobles who couldn't make it anywhere else in the Spanish governemnt.Replacing them with more capable administrators would be a great first step to solve the problem."

ile:0 "Institucion Libre Enseñanza"
ile_desc:0 "A movement rather than an organization, the Institution for Free Learning in Spain seeks to address the reactionary religious education promoted throughout Spain. With just a bit of government support, perhaps more modernist, secular education could have a home here."
lasreformasdecanalejas:0 "The Canalejas Administration"
lasreformasdecanalejas_desc:0 "The Liberal Turno, José Canalejas, has started an uncharacteristically ambitious group of reforms in Spain aimed at essentially all walks of life. While most of these reforms are fairly radical, by Spanish standards anyway, King Alfonso can be the backing force for Canalejas's more interesting ideas."
asegurandoelprotectorado:0 "Rifan Rail"
asegurandoelprotectorado_desc:0 "Infrastructure in the Rif is almost nonexistent. Outside of Ceuta and Melilla's city limits, there are a few unpaved roads connecting a few mining sites and villages, with many areas being entirely unconnected. Establishing a rail system would help us keep control in the region, and make the most of our local operations."
industriaarmamentistica:0 "Spanish Steel Pistols"
industriaarmamentistica_desc:0 "The Basque steel industry has given way to local gun manufacturing by cottage manufacturers like Bonifacio Echeverria and small factories like the P.Unceta y J.Esperanza firm. With a reputation for high-grade steel, these weapons are popular- and promoting their mass production would be a boon for our military industry."
ferrocarriles:0 "Eastern Railways"
ferrocarriles_desc:0 "With the recent developments in the Basque Counties and Catalonia, attaching these regions to the existing Spanish rail system has become more important than ever. Even the old existing rail could stand to be electrified."
avance:0 "Edad de Plata"
avance_desc:0 "With even more reforms in place as well as a recent boom in Spanish art, patriotic fervour is returning to Spain, as the people seemingly once again have something to be proud of.​ The newfound belief that Spain really can become a power again has inspired those seeking new methods of helping make the dream a reality."
basesaereas:0 "Servicio de Aeronáutica Militar"
basesaereas_desc:0 "One good way to help re-establish Spain as a power is an air force of some capacity. Though still unproven, few doubt that planes will have an important role to at least some degree in future conflicts. Establishing some airfields and purchasing and arming some Civilian aircraft would be a good start."
reformandolatropa:0 "Military Observers"
reformandolatropa_desc:0 "Spain is in the rare position of being more or less liked (or at least tolerated) by every European power. Our military can take advantage of this by analyzing foreign exercises and observing conflicts, to find out what everyone else is doing and see what works and what doesn't."
reformandolosmandos:0 "Colonial Warfare"
reformandolosmandos_desc:0 "With the modest resurgence of our colonial empire in combination with the resurgence of our modest fleet, Spain must restart joint exercises between Marines and the Fleet to ensure that our colonies aren't simply seized in short order in a colonial war."
mandocentral:0 "Mando Central"
mandocentral_desc:0 "With the Spanish Navy rebuilt and the Spanish Air Force in the process of creation, the old military structure of the Army is no longer suitable for the Spanish military. Establishing a Central Command to organize all of the arms of the military will increase its effectivity, as well as introduce new leaders with exciting ideas."
elfuturodelpais:0 "Nuevo Día"
elfuturodelpais_desc:0 "Despite it all, Spain is back. The humiliation of 1898 and the Tragic Week have been forgotten, and the Industry is starting to catch up to European standards. Diplomats are courting Spain again, and the people are happier than they've been in a long time. ¡Vida, vida, futuro de la Patria, que en tus ojos es, abierto corazon!"
fuerzasarmadas20:0 "La legion"
fuerzasarmadas20_desc:0 "France's Foreign Legion has been quite helpful in their attempts to pacify North Africa. Creating a Foreign Legion of our own, bestowing upon them the legendary name of ''Tercio'', and sending them to keep order in Spanish Africa could give us the same level of control over our own colonies."
eldesastredel98:0 "Recuperandonos del 98"
eldesastredel98_desc:0 "El desastre de 1898 llevó a la pérdida de la práctica totalidad de las pocas colonias ultramarinas que permanecían bajo soberanía española: Cuba, Puerto Rico, Filipinas además de algunas islas del pacífíco como las Marianas o Palaos. No obstante, la repatriación de capitales y una notable sacudida ideológica y social en forma de reacción regeneracionista permitió que España entrara en el siglo XX en un periodo de notable vitalidad"

While the nation has been fine under the guidance of the system of old for years, these turbulent times require a government that is in position to respond to them. Whether we choose to change our ways as a nation, or bolster our existing government to stand up to new external threats, political change can do nothing but benefit our nation and people's future."

 SPR_sovereignist_ethos:0 "Centralization"
 SPR_sovereignist_ethos_desc:0 "The authority of the state has been too split for too long. By reducing the powers of our substates compared to our central government, we will overcome regionalism and factionalism to make a stronger nation, which will inevitably open the door to enact further measures."

 SPR_monarchy:0 "Authoritarianism Focus"
 SPR_monarchy_desc:0 "The powers exercised by the parliament and people can be dangerous. The only true way to keep control of our nation, particularly in such trying times, would be to adopt a generally authoritarian position, and rule over our country as it's meant to be ruled."

Over hundreds of years, however, much of this territory has been inefficiently laid out or used.

 SPR_diplomatic_effort_desc:0 "It is becoming increasingly difficult to stay in the middle of the affairs in the world as it stands. Our diplomatic corps is already asking if we're to be involved in the coming power struggle, or if we are to stay out of things entirely. While we can't answer that question quite yet, we can easily expand our corps to be able to choose one of these options."

 SPR_takeposition:0 "Take Position"
 SPR_takeposition_desc:0 "Our place in the world is tenuous at best. After all, with the great empires at each others' throats, what's to stop one from turning on us once they're through? We must bet on the winning horse, and quickly, to ensure ourselves a place at the council of victors instead of as a footnote in a history book."

 SPR_supportgermany:0 "Support Germany"
 SPR_supportgermany_desc:0 "With the German Empire's massive industrial sector, they seem to be the clear-cut bet, even if they are diplomatically isolated. Showing public support to the Germans on even a few, non-key matters will send a message that we're moving closer to the Central Powers."

 SPR_supportfrance:0 "Support France"
 SPR_supportfrance_desc:0 "Though France's industry can't compete with Germany's, they have far more friends, and we'd even be one more. By supporting France on in a few of the upcoming diplomatic issues, we may just win them over."

 SPR_supportaustria:0 "Support Austria-Hungary"
 SPR_supportaustria_desc:0 "The old empire of Austria-Hungary has lived to see the rise of most of the major nations on the world map. So, surely, if we want to become seen as a more major nation, what better country to support? This will also help us draw closer to the Central Powers." 

 SPR_supportrussia:0 "Support Russia"
 SPR_supportrussia_desc:0 "The Russian Empire is in pretty dire need of international help. For the nation whose former leader coined the term ''Sick Man of Russia'', they cannot be particularly healthy themselves. Our support will, if nothing else, help them hang on long enough to do something decisive."

 SPR_military_reserve:0 "Military Reserve"
 SPR_military_reserve_desc:0 "War could easily come to our borders at a moment's notice, and therefore, we have to be prepared for the worst. A Military Reserve of loosely trained conscripts will be of little true value in the case of a war, but these impressionable young men getting a taste of the army life may very easily convince them to join the real thing."

 SPR_embargo_germany:0 "Sanction Germany"
 SPR_embargo_germany_desc:0 "Germany's illegal Submarine attacks are an insult to free trade! Though a sanction will draw us slightly further from neutrality, it will make us far harder to exploit by the merchants of the German Empire."

 SPR_embargo_france:0 "Sanction France"
 SPR_embargo_france_desc:0 "France's diplomatic scheming and backstabbing are unforgivable! Though a sanction will make us appear and act far less neutral in the war situation, it's unlikely to spiral into anything bad, and more importantly, will ensure France cannot take advantage of us!" 

 SPR_sellweapons:0 "Sell Weapons"
 SPR_sellweapons_desc:0 "Though the tension of the world is the highest it's ever been, even this stormcloud has a silver lining. As we have no interest in joining the fight, we can easily hawk our weapons and weapon designs- even to both sides of a conflict, if we want- and make a killing off of the misfortunes of others. Their fault for starting the war."

 SPR_appeasement:0 "Appeasement"
 SPR_appeasement_desc:0 "Sometimes, flattery is the best way to save your own skin. Appeasing the larger powers is no prestigous action to have in your playbook, but if used at the right time, simply giving another nation what it wants can be a far lot safer than seeing what happens if you don't...so long as you remember to draw the line somewhere."

 SPR_aggressive_foreign_policy:0 "Aggressive Foreign Policy"
 SPR_aggressive_foreign_policy_desc:0 "Actually, you know what? On second thought, Neutrality is boring. To hell with it. We're ready to get involved in this war, and we're gonna come out swinging!"

 SPR_joingermany:0 "Join Central Powers"
 SPR_joingermany_desc:0 "The Central Powers have long been a friend to our nation, and desperately need help in these most uncertain times. Joining them is a one-way ticket into the war on their side, and we better be in it to win it if we are, but we could turn the tides to a decisive victory on their part."

 SPR_joinfrance:0 "Join Entente"
 SPR_joinfrance_desc:0 "The Entente currently seem to be in the better position to win the war, and we wouldn't want to be caught missing the peace conference once they do. Joining the Entente will definitely pull us into war, which could wind up disastrously, but at least we'll have allies to help, right?" 

 SPR_war_effort:0 "War Effort"
 SPR_war_effort_desc:0 "With the world in its current state, we can't afford to let other nations pass over our military. By expanding our industrial base, we can ensure we'll have enough guns and shells to come out on top."
